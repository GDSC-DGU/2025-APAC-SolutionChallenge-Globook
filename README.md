#### Problem
Access to knowledge is often limited by language, file format, and production cost. These barriers make valuable content inaccessible—especially for non-native speakers and the visually impaired.

#### Our Solution
Globook is an automated platform that transforms a single PDF file into multilingual, audio-accessible content. It structures the document, translates it using AI, and generates audio via TTS—without requiring translators or voice actors.

#### Why It's Different
Most existing tools offer only partial solutions (e.g., translation or TTS alone). Globook unifies the entire pipeline into one seamless process—structure, translate, vocalize, and distribute. This lowers the barrier to global publishing for individuals and small teams.

#### Impact
We enable anyone—students, researchers, content creators—to access and share knowledge across languages and formats. Globook is more than a tool. It’s a new infrastructure for inclusive, scalable knowledge distribution.
